# Sudoku Online Game

Sudoku online game is a web app built with the python flask framework that allows the user to play the game based on the chosen difficulty level. The user can also visualize how the computer solves the game.

# How do we play Sudoko?

Sudoku is a popular puzzle game in which missing numbers are filled into a 9 by 9 grid of squares subdivided into 3 by 3 boxes so that every row, every column, and every box contains the numbers 1 through 9.

As mentioned above, three conditions need to be met to complete the puzzle:

* Fill all the rows of the puzzle with the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition
* Fill all the columns of the puzzle with the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition
* Fill all the 3 by 3 boxes of the puzzle with the numbers 1 to 9 without repetition

# What I learn out of this project
* Deeper Understanding of Backtracking Algorithm
* How to break down big problems into smaller ones.
* Flask and JavaScript revision

# About the code
### Languages used in the project

1. Python (Flask Framework)
2. JavaScript (Fetch API)
3. HTML5 
4. CSS3

I used python to write the algorithms for the logic of the game. Some of these include generating a random, partially filled sudoku grid based on the difficulty level and solving the generated sudoku grid.

I used JavaScript (Fetch API) to send data to the backend (Python) for interpretation and analysis.

I also used javascript for visualizing the animation.

Feel free to go through the project, clone it, reproduce it, and play around with the code. I hope you learn as much as I did.

You can also send a pull request.
